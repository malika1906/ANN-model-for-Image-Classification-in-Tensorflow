# ANN-model-for-Image-Classification-in-Tensorflow

Deep Learning Project in Python with Keras, which is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.
It is part of the TensorFlow library, used here to define and train neural network model.

A dataset of images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples has been used.
Data preparation is done - reshaping data and spliting into training and testing dataset.

ANN model of 2 dense layers has been built and trained.
Evaluation of the ANN model gave an accuracy of 87.40%.
